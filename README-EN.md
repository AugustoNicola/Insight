Insight is a full-stack applicaton for reading and writing blog posts, with many features such as user creation, file uploading, a reaction system supporting *likes*, comments, and saves, post tags, filtering and post editing.

Both *frontend* and *backend* were written with the PHP framework, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x) `v.8.81.0`, connected to a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database. The *frontend* also uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) for applying CSS styles.
